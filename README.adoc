= AWKDoc

Wanted to learn AWK for some time.
This feels like a good project for that.


== Recognition
Obvious inspiration, and some outright function theft, from https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc[shdoc].

There were a few edge cases I didn't love, largely surrounding handling leading whitespace.

Doubt I'll ever reach the quality of `shdoc` (including impressive testing suite).
Though trying my own version, and with different approach.


== Hopeful additions
=== Typedefs
Rather than a freeform type hint, should support declaring locations where a type is defined in code.

[source,bash]
----
# @typedef SOMETHING
declare -a SOMETHING
----

May feel a little repetitive, except it's also useful for dynamic declarations.

[source,bash]
----
# @typedef SOMETHING
declare -a "$VAR"=
----

=== Location information
Should tag each type & function with filename & line number.


=== Expanded multiline support
Ideally everything should allow for multiline descriptions.
