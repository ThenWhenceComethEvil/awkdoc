= AWKDoc

Wanted to learn AWK for some time.
This feels like a good project for that.

== Recognition
Obvious inspiration, and some outright function theft, from https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc[shdoc].

There were a few edge cases I didn't love, largely surrounding leading whitespace in descriptions.

Doubt I'll ever reach the quality of `shdoc` (including impressive testing suite).
Though trying my own version, with different approach.
